# To Do List

A simple to do list to organize your day. This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. It uses the Express, Body-parser, and Lodash modules to allow users to create custom task lists using Express routing parameters; each page is dynamically rendered using EJS templating. Inside the app.js, Mongoose CRUD operations were implemented to store infinite documents under two sets of integrated collections. The app was deployed to the Heroku server with MongoDB Atlas running in the backend to continuously store and update data.
